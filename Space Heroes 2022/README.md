## my experience
I enjoyed this one :) and learnt a couple of new things. In particular, I found the forensics ones really interesting because they involved some things I'd never/rarely think of, and challenged me in areas I was not quite familiar with - such as more on tshark/command line, as well as the icmp protocol. The web category lent confidence to my rudimentary web skills because I was able to figure things out along the way (like cookies, and basic deobfuscation). Some of the crypto challenges gave me satisfaction - and also some confidence in using Sage ðŸ˜„ Unfortunately, it is now a monday night for me and I have school so I shall only do 2 writeups and see if I can come back and do more in the future ðŸ¥²
