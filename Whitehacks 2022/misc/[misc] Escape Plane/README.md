## Solution
Recon
“Colourful plane”... Alright, so we should be taking a look at bit planes. 

### Solving 
You can use any online tool (e.g. StegOnline) that lets you look at bit planes. We get 3 QR codes - one from the Red Plane, one from the Blue Plane and one from the Green Plane. <br>

Scan them one by one with our phones and we are done. <br>
