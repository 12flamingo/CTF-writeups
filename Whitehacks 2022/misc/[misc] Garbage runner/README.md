# [misc] Garbage runner
Author: xbowery
Difficulty: Easy

## Challenge description:
The mischievous aliens have dumped our lovely poster into the trash can, maybe you can walk through it to find some treasure?

### Files:
* treasure.pdf

---
## Solution
### Recon
Garbage => Bin = Binwalk
Runner => …run binwalk? 
In the description, “walk through it” also hints at binwalk :)

### Solving 
Extracting the files with binwalk, we find a couple of files in the folder and all that’s left to do is to look through them quickly to find the flag (which shows up plainly in one of the jpeg). <br>

As a bonus, you will also find lovely background music for all to enjoy.
