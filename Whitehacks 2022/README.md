## my experience
Returning from WH2021, I was glad to find I had a less foggy idea of what I was doing It could be in part attributed to the fact that the CTF’s challenge descriptions were packed with hints (in very nice wordplay), making a couple of them relatively accessible in terms of difficulty :) That worked out pretty well for me as I ended up spamming the ones tagged “easy/medium” for the most part although I do wish I realised earlier and read the descriptions more carefully! (instead of skipping to the files) It certainly would have saved some time this round. Lesson learnt!
