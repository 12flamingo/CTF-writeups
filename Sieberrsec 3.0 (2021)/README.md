## organizer details
> Sieberrsec CTF 3.0 is a Cybersecurity Jeopardy-Style Capture-The-Flag Competition for Junior College and Secondary school students. Teams of up to 2 are allowed, but optional. There will be many challenges catering to low-to-medium difficulty levels, and some harder challenges too. Sieberrsec CTF 3.0 is organised by the Hwa Chong Institution Infocomm and Robotics Society's Cybersecurity Section, also known as Sieberrsec.

## my experience
Sieberrsec was a really well-organised CTF and I had an enjoyable time overall (except maybe OSINT because of the amount of detail demanded - but good practice I suppose!). I also regret that I was unable to spend the whole day on this one because there were quite a few challenges that I felt would have been doable for me if I had the time :'. Another aspect of this CTF was the small team size + variety of challenges - and given that I went solo, I paid for my lack of confidence in Web (just like in TISC). If I can afford it I should probably strengthen my CTF web fundamentals. However, I am happy with my progress on Crypto from which I derived most of my points this time.
