# ctf writeups
In my first year of CTFs (2021), I wanted to do CTF writeups but found myself making excuses from having almost no knowledge to share to reasons like not having enough time (both of which still trouble me). Nevertheless, I think itâ€™s a worthwhile endeavour (plus it's fun!) and perhaps one day I will have more to say, and I'll be better at saying it. So this year, I will Make Time for CTF writeups :)
